Key Requirements for iOS Web PushTo make push notifications work on an iPhone or iPad, your PWA must satisfy these conditions:Added to Home Screen: The user must manually tap the Share button in Safari and select "Add to Home Screen." Notifications will not work if the user is just browsing your site in the Safari app.4Web App Manifest: Your manifest.json must include "display": "standalone" or "fullscreen".5Service Worker: You must have a registered Service Worker that listens for the push event.6User Gesture: You cannot trigger the permission prompt automatically on page load. The user must perform a "gesture" (like clicking a "Subscribe" button) inside the Home Screen app to trigger the native permission dialog.7HTTPS: Your site must be served over a secure connection.8How the Workflow WorksStepAction1. RegistrationThe PWA registers a Service Worker and uses the PushManager API to get a unique subscription (endpoint).2. StorageYour frontend sends this subscription object (the endpoint URL and keys) to your backend server.3. TriggerWhen you want to send a notification, your server sends a request to the Apple Push Notification service (APNs) using those stored keys.4. DeliveryAPNs pushes the message to the device. The Service Worker wakes up, even if the PWA is closed, and displays the alert.Technical LimitationsiOS Version: Only works on iOS 16.4 or later.9VAPID Keys: You must use VAPID (Voluntary Application Server Identification) to identify your server to Apple’s push service.10Browser Dependency: While users can now add PWAs to the Home Screen from third-party browsers (like Chrome or Firefox) on iOS, the underlying technology still relies on Apple's WebKit push implementation.Implementation Checklist[ ] Ensure your manifest.json is linked correctly in the <head>.11[ ] Verify the Service Worker is active.[ ] Create a UI button that calls Notification.requestPermission().[ ] Use a library like web-push for your backend to handle the encryption and delivery to Apple's servers.
